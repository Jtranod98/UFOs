# UFOs

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Overview:

The purpose of this excercise is to create an interactive webpage that will allow users to input multiple filters for the data around UFO sightings. Then display the table according to the user's input search.

In this excercise, I'll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I'll also create filters to make this table dynamic, meaning that it will take in the user's input, filter the data according to the user's input and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.


## Challenge

Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria at the same.  The criteria are: city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:

   ### Examples: 

   -Search by 1 criteria. city. 
    The table will display all UFOs sightinsg with the city matching user's input search.

## Summary:


One drawback of this project is that it's using outdated data 2010. 

Two recommendations are:
    1. Ability to have access to the latest informations, 2022 data.
    2. A message inform the user when information of a request is not found, instead of a blank screen.
